# Tempo Runtime - AtomicOS

The deterministic operating system kernel and runtime for Tempo applications.

## Structure

- `kernel/` - Core kernel implementation
- `drivers/` - Hardware drivers (keyboard, timer, network, etc.)
- `fs/` - AtomicFS file system implementation
- `net/` - Network stack (TCP/IP, ethernet)
- `memory/` - Memory management (PMM, VMM)
- `ipc/` - Inter-process communication

## Features

- **Deterministic Scheduling**: WCET-aware task scheduling
- **Real-Time Guarantees**: Hard real-time constraints
- **Memory Safety**: Zero buffer overflows, use-after-free
- **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free data structures
- **Security Layers**: 12-layer security architecture
