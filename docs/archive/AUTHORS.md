### Contributions
- Conceived the vision of deterministic programming for democratizing computing
- Designed the Chronos language syntax and semantics
- Implemented the 3-stage bootstrap compiler
- Developed the no-import philosophy for offline-first programming
- Wrote the Chronos Bible and comprehensive documentation
- Designed the revolutionary compiler course (27 lessons)

### Vision Statement
"Chronos was born from the belief that reliable, deterministic computing should not be a privilege of tech giants. Small businesses in Latin America, medical device manufacturers in Africa, and retail traders worldwide deserve the same guarantees as billion-dollar companies. With Chronos, we level the playing field - making deterministic programming accessible to everyone, everywhere, even without internet."

## Acknowledgments

This project represents a revolutionary approach to programming language design, prioritizing determinism, offline capabilities, and democratization of technology over traditional metrics.

Special thanks to the communities that inspired this work:
- Small businesses (PyMEs) fighting to compete with tech monopolies
- Rural healthcare providers needing reliable offline systems
- Retail traders seeking fair access to deterministic trading systems
- Developers worldwide who believe in technological sovereignty

## Contributing

Chronos is open source under the MIT license. We welcome contributions that align with our core principles:
- Deterministic execution
- Offline-first design
- No external dependencies
- Democratization of computing
